# SnakeFusion
Using the genetic algorithm and neural networks I trained up 5 snakes who will then fuse to become the ultimate snake, this is how I did it

The program I used to write and run this code was processing https://processing.org/download/

If you get it working some instructions
press Space to just show the current best from  each population
press d to double the mutation rate
press h to halve it 
after you run it some snakes will be saved press 0 to 4 to check them out
to further train the snakes of legend (the saved snakes) press L
to fuse snakes together to create a super snake press f

I hope my commenting makes sense 

Have fun :)

## Initial Setup
### Download and Install Processing 3: https://processing.org/download/

### Clone This Repository

If you have git installed, type the following into your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/Code-Bullet/SnakeFusion.git
```

Else, download the zip file and unpack by clicking the green "Clone and download" button on the top right of the screen.

### Open The Project Files
1. Open the Processing application
2. Click `File > Open`
3. Go to where you downloaded the files for this repository, the folder should be called `SmartSnakesCombine`
4. Inside the `SmartSnakesCombine` folder click on the file called `Snake.pde`
5. You should now see `Snake.pde` as well as the rest of the files opened up in the Processing application
6. Press the ***Run*** button or click `Sketch > Run`

## Controls

`Space` - Show the current best from  each population

`D` - Double the mutation rate

`H` - Half the mutation rate

`0 to 4` -  Look at the saved snakes

`L` - Further train the saved snakes

`F` - Fuse snakes together to create a super snake
