# SnakeFusion
Using the [Genetic Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) and [Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network) I trained up 5 snakes who will then fuse to become the ultimate snake, this is how I did it.

The program I used to write and run this code was [Processing](https://processing.org/download/)

If you get it working, here are some instructions:
 - press Space to just show the current best from  each population
 - press d to double the mutation rate
 - press h to halve it 
 - after you run it some snakes will be saved press 0 to 4 to check them out
 - to further train the snakes of legend (the saved snakes) press L
 - to fuse snakes together to create a super snake press f

I hope my commenting makes sense 

Have fun :)
